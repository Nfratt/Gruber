# GRUBER

Want Groceries on demand? Well Gruber is for you!!!


To use this React app simply sign in then add products to your cart!



Once you have picked out everything you like enter your payment info via Stripe.


Once you see payment complete your order has been confirmed( does not actually bill and will not actually place an order at the moment)


All products are stored using MongoDB then rendered to our landing page.


Each portion of the landing page is created using a react component and exported to the app.jsx file.
